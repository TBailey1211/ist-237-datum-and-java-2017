		Here is a little information about me:<br>
		I am 22 years old and in my 3rd semester of the computer programming course at TTC. I have a twin sister who recently graduated this past May and is currently working as a 5th grade elementary teacher in Clemson. I do my schooling from home and live across the road from my mother and step-dad who recently married. I have two dogs and a cat: a chihuahua, a yorkie, and a siamese. I am a self-taught artist and have been working as a freelancer for over 5 years. I also enjoy reading and writing on top of creating artwork.
